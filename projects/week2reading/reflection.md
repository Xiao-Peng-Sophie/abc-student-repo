I’m attracted by the idea that the tendency in web design could reflect people’s changing attitudes towards the internet, technology, and social realities. For instance, in the first reading, the author mentions the “under construction” icon and “starry night” background, which signify how people perceive the nature of the web space and their expectations of science and technology.  I think that’s why we need to research on the history of the “hidden” vernacular webs like Lialina did––they provide us with fabulous landscape of  people’s dreams/fantasies/expectations/demands towards a desirable life at different time, which help us imagine our own future from a perspective of history. That reminds me of the unconventional, anti-user friendly websites designed by Yehwan Song, where she explores and experiments with different ways of interaction. And I wonder if that reflects our imagination towards the expanding interface of web pages and will become a significant moment throughout the history of web design.
