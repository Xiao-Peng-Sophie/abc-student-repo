    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p id="name">晓     曉</p>
  <p>In Chinese, my name is written as 晓, which is a pictograph and is derived from the basic simulation of natural scenes through painting. On the left part of 晓 is a 日，which stands for “the sun”. The character 日 has evolved a lot and it originally appeared as the shape of the sun, which is a round with a dot inside. As for the right side, 尧 represents the mound. That’s because 尧 has also experienced a series of changes throughout the  history of Chinese characters and it was written as 堯 before, which consists of three 土 characters, which represent piles of soil in Chinese. Therefore, given that 日 refers to the sun and 尧 refers to the mound, 晓 carries the meaning of “morning” by vividly presenting a drawing in which the sun rises in the morning.<br><br>(From a self-introduction writing assignment a long time ago)
